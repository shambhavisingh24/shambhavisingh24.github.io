## Hey there!
### Thanks for visiting my website! This is my first post, and I want to outline what I'm trying to achieve with it. 

Once I started working full time, post my undergrad, I have had a feeling that I am not learning new things as much as I want to. Hence, I built this website to ensure I keep learning new things and continue to keep the momentum that I know I can acheive.

I want this website to be a catch-all landing page for anything and everything that I make and put on the internet. For instance, I want to use the website to be a home to:
- **a blog** where I can dump some of my thoughts from time to time
- **all side projects**, including source code and documentation, you can find my side projects [here](https://shambhavisingh24.github.io/categories/#projects)
- **anything else** that I end up making/working on that doesn't fall under the other categories

I'm excited for what the future holds :)
