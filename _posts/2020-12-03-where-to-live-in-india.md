I recently started using R and while surfing through the internet I landed on [Maëlle Salmon’s](https://masalmon.eu/2017/11/16/wheretoliveus/) blog which started a trend on twitter to find the ideal cities to live in different parts of world, based on your climate preference. I thought why not do something like this for India. Maëlle Salmon’s blog post was originally inspired by [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1916/).
