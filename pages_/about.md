I'm Shambhavi, a data analyst at ICICI Bank. I have done my undergrad in Mathematics from St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi. I have deep interest in data analysis and visualization. I am interested in doing data analysis/visualization for NGOs, charities, non-profits (#DataForGood).

------------------

When I'm not working on meeting deadlines, I'm either working on [side projects](/projects), reading, talking to my plants, or making some art. 

---------------------

Here's some of what I'm doing these days:
- **Current Academic Side Project:** Making this website!
- **Currently Reading**: _A Suitable Boy_ by Vikram Seth(hoping to this finish this by end of this year). Find my Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91427372-shambhavi). 
- **Currently obsessively listening**: Lucky Ali! <3 Find my spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/31jtu55hrzw5qhjtzlleokpy556i)
